p{
    color: black;
    background-color: rgb(160, 145, 95);
}

Important Note:
1. Inline css is preferred over any other
   a.Internal css in head
   b.External css link with any other css file in head tag.
2. If there is no Inline Css in the tag and have both Internal and External CSS in head tag then one which at the bottom will be given priority.
   Also if you want to give any property permanent like background-color--> write "!important" there to keep it permanent. For example we did in tut10.html in background color in internal tag.
